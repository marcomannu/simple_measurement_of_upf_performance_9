## Performance Measurement

This section covers how to measure UPF performance effectively.

### Latency Measurement

Latency is a critical metric in network performance. To measure latency, you can use tools like Scapy or DPDK. The project includes scripts that automate this process.

### Throughput Testing

Throughput refers to the amount of data transmitted over a network in a given time. Use TREX or similar traffic generators to simulate real-world traffic patterns. The results will help identify bottlenecks in the UPF.

### Packet Loss Analysis

Packet loss can significantly impact user experience. Monitor packet loss during your tests to understand the reliability of your UPF setup. Use tools integrated into the project to collect this data.
